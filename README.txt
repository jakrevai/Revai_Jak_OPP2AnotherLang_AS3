This project was created during my Diploma of Software Development at TAFE Queensland.
It was a solo project to produce a working Simple chat room application, using NamedPipes which enables the two seperate .exe's to talk to eachother while keeping the GUI updated with Threading

If you would like to run the project you can either open up the project solution, or open run.bat located in the same folder as the readme file
This was created with Visual Studio 2012 so hopefully the project files can be opened, if not then the .cs files are all found in the Revai_Jak_OPP2AnotherLang_AS3 and Client folders
